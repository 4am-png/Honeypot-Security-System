# Honeypot Security System

A scalable and containerized Honeypot designed to detect malicious activity by mimicking vulnerable services and logging attack data for analysis. Now enhanced with Go, C++, and Terraform for better performance, security, and scalability.

## 🚀 Features
- **Fake services**: Simulates vulnerable services to attract malicious traffic.
- **Logging attacks**: Captures IP addresses, user agents, and requested paths.
- **Real-time monitoring**: Monitors traffic and displays metrics using Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Containerized setup**: Easily deploys using Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automate deployment with Terraform.
- **Go and C++ Services**: Efficient traffic processing and attack detection.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python (Flask), Go
- **Traffic Analysis**: C++
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Web Server**: Nginx
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Containers**: Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To get started with the Honeypot Security System, ensure you have Docker, Docker Compose, and Terraform installed.

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/honeypot-security.git
cd honeypot-security
```

### 2. Deploy Infrastructure (Optional, for cloud deployment)
If you wish to deploy the system on a cloud provider using Terraform:
```bash
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### 3. Set up the environment
Install the Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Start the services
Run the entire system using Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:
- **Honeypot** service (Flask API) on port `5000`
- **PostgreSQL** as the database to store log data
- **Nginx** to proxy requests
- **Go-based backend** for handling requests efficiently
- **C++ Traffic Analyzer** for analyzing network data
- **Prometheus** for monitoring (available at `http://localhost:9090`)
- **Grafana** for visualizing data (available at `http://localhost:3000`)

### 5. Configure Grafana
Once Grafana is running, open `http://localhost:3000` and log in with default credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

Import the Honeypot dashboard by uploading the `honeypot-dashboard.json` from `monitoring/grafana/`.

### 6. View Logs
Attack logs are stored in PostgreSQL and can be accessed via a database client or API queries.

## 📊 Monitoring and Analytics
- **Prometheus** collects metrics such as request counts, response times, and error rates.
- **Grafana** visualizes these metrics via pre-configured dashboards.

### 🚧 To Do:
- Expand Terraform support for multi-cloud environments.
- Add more fake services to interact with different attack vectors.
- Improve logging and alerting for real-time attack detection.

---

## 💡 Ideas for Future Enhancements
- **Email alerts**: Send email notifications when an attack is detected.
- **Advanced analytics**: Use AI/ML for detecting attack patterns.
- **More fake services**: Include SSH, FTP, and other vulnerable services for broader coverage.
